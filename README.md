# Project Todos
Use redux to create a ToDo list application. The app should list all tasks - completed or uncompleted. You should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncompleted). Be able to add and remove tasks. The app should show a count of either all todos or all uncompleted todos (or both).

## The problem

I mapped in figma before starting, mapped out the reducer, components and styling 
If I had more time I would have some output.
